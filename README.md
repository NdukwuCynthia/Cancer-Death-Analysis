PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a world where the fear of cancer looms large among the adult population, understanding the factors that contribute to the diagnosis of cancer is paramount. This study aims to investigate the impact of various patient data points and the likelihood of a cancer diagnosis. By analyzing a dataset that includes information on age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, genetic risk, physical activity, alcohol intake, cancer history, and diagnosis, we hope to provide insights into how these factors affect the probability of developing cancer. The ultimate goal is to alleviate fears by identifying modifiable risk factors and informing preventive strategies.About Dataset 

Goals:
Identify Key Risk Factors:
 Determine which factors (e.g., smoking, genetic risk, BMI) are most strongly associated with a cancer diagnosis. 
Understand Demographic Patterns: Explore how age and gender influence cancer risk.
Assess Lifestyle Impacts: Evaluate the impact of lifestyle choices such as physical activity and alcohol intake on cancer risk.
Inform Preventive Strategies:Provide actionable insights that can help individuals reduce their risk of cancer through lifestyle changes or early screenings.

DESCRIPTION 
This dataset contains medical and lifestyle information for 1500 patients, designed to predict the 
presence of cancer based on various features. The dataset is structured to provide a realistic challenge 
for predictive modeling in the medical domain. 
Dataset Structure 
Features 
1. Age: Integer values representing the patient's age, ranging from 20 to 80. 
2. Gender: Binary values representing gender, where 0 indicates Male and 1 indicates Female. 
3. BMI: Continuous values representing Body Mass Index, ranging from 15 to 40. 
4. Smoking: Binary values indicating smoking status, where 0 means No and 1 means Yes. 
5. GeneticRisk: Categorical values representing genetic risk levels for cancer, with 0 indicating 
Low, 1 indicating Medium, and 2 indicating High. 
6. PhysicalActivity: Continuous values representing the number of hours per week spent on 
physical activities, ranging from 0 to 10. 
7. AlcoholIntake: Continuous values representing the number of alcohol units consumed per 
week, ranging from 0 to 5. 
8. CancerHistory: Binary values indicating whether the patient has a personal history of cancer, 
where 0 means No and 1 means Yes. 
9. Diagnosis: Binary values indicating the cancer diagnosis status, where 0 indicates No Cancer 
and 1 indicates Cancer.
